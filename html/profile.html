            <p>
                The worldwide phenomenon of The Hunger Games continues to set the world on fire with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, which finds Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in District 13 after she literally shatters the games forever. Under the leadership of President Coin (Julianne Moore) and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss spreads her wings as she fights to save Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and a nation moved by her courage. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Danny Strong and Peter Craig and produced by Nina Jacobson's Color Force in tandem with producer Jon Kilik. The novel on which the film is based is the third in a trilogy written by Suzanne Collins that has over 65 million copies in print in the U.S. alone. (c) Lionsgate

                    <p>When teenaged Andy plops down on the grass to share his old toys with a shy little girl, the film spikes with sadness and layered pleasure -- a concise, deeply wise expression of the ephemeral that feels real and yet utterly transporting.</p>

                    <p> I FELT so virtuous handing over $1 for the Buzz Lightyear action figure my 3-year-old daughter found amid the wreckage at the charity bazaar. Little did I know she'd stolen it from a younger kid. We had heard about the bazaar on a local parenting e-mail list: it was a fund-raiser for Jonah's Just Begun, a foundation for children with Sanfilippo syndrome, a horrible disease that I'd never heard of and that currently has no cure. My husband dragged the twins to the back of the bazaar for face-painting -- a rainbow with a star that curiously resembled the Libyan liberation flag -- while I scavenged the rich-but-not-sorted-by-size piles of castoffs. Everything was $1: gray sweat pants with pink and purple hearts; a purple fleecy sweatshirt; and a plush snowsuit in size 18 months that I couldn't leave there, even though I will never have another 18-month-old. I'd give it to a friend.</p>
